# RealIP - Fabric

A plugin for TCP Shield that tells the server the real IP addresses of clients connecting to it.

Drop this into your server's `mods` directory and run, should be as easy as that. There are a couple of configuration
options available in the generated configuration file, they should be okay as is however.
